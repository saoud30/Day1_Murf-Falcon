# 🎙️ Murf AI – 10 Days of Voice Agents Challenge

This repository contains all my work for the **Murf Falcon 10-Day Voice Agent Challenge**, where I build one new voice agent every day using:

- **LiveKit Agents**
- **Deepgram STT**
- **Gemini LLM**
- **Murf Falcon TTS** (fastest TTS API)
- Custom personas, tools, state machines, and more.

Each day has its own folder and documentation.
